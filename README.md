##### About:
- Hello, I’m Peter Flint
- I’m interested in horticulture, meteorology, philosophy, mythology, and landscape architecture. 
- I’m currently working toward learning data science with R, web design with components.ai, building capacity w/ QGIS, and garden ecology through a number of sources. 
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will improve overall digital literacy, proficiency in R, and data science in general. I am happy to share my expertise in social and ecological systems thinking.
